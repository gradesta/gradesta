The Gradesta Ethical Codex
-------------------------------

This Ethical codex applies to Commercial ventures run under the Gradesta brand. It does not have any effect on the application of Gradesta open source licenses, or the ability of third parties to use Gradesta software in any way that they desire.

Core Value 1: Consent
-------------------------

We do not engage in or facilitate non-consensual transactions (commercial or otherwise) including those involving non-human animals and children. This value has a wide array of applications:

1. Animal agriculture: Animals are incapable of giving consent. Therefore, we will not produce or market any products intended for use in the animal agriculture industry. We will also not consume animal products on company dime. So if food is provided by Gradesta, for example at an event, it will only be vegan.

2. Advertising: We won't sell our user's time without their consent, and we don't consider a popup dialog to be consent. We divide advertising into primary channel and secondary channel. Primary channel advertising is advertising that the user seeks out, for example a product comparison that is clearly marked as paid promotion. The user wants to buy something and seeks out information about products. Another example of primary channel advertising is booths at a conference. The user knows that those booths are paid, and the user seeks them out. Secondary channel advertising is when advertisement appears along side the content that the user sought and is not desired by the user. If they had a choice, they would hide it. There will be no secondary channel paid advertising on Gradesta platforms. We do not sell our user's time unless they want us to.

3. Medical testing: Medical testing on animals and children is typically non-consensual. We will not engage in or work directly on projects that do this, unless they have an internal ethical codex that ensures that the testing is in the interest of the subjects. For lab rats this is rarely the case. For children dying of leukemia we will leave that decision up to the children's parents and at least 2 independent experts.

4. Likenesses: This is a tricky case. Generally if someone's picture or likeness is on our platform and that person contacts us and asks us to remove that picture, we will remove it. However, in some instances, it may be in the public's interest to non-consensual view a picture, for example, the famous portrait of Prince Andrew and Virginia Giuffre may be of public interest, even if Prince Andrew does not want to have the image distributed.

5. Conscientious objection: Should a worker find a particular task to be ethically objectionable and there is another task that they are equally capable of fulfilling which they do not find to be objectionable. They should be able to choose the other task or project without repercussions.

6. Business Transparency: Our customers should always know our business model and how we make money. We make money by providing value to our customers, not through trickery.

Core Value 2: Environment, Habitat, and Biodiversity
--------------------------------------------------------------

Internal business operations will be conducted in such a way as to minimize their impact on the environment, sustainability and biodiversity. This has impacts on several factors:

1. Campuses and offices. Any land owned or operated by Gradesta will be operated in such a way as to strictly increase the native biodiversity of the land and must never decrease the land's biodiversity. One example of how land can be managed to increase biodiversity is planting a variety of native plants and using green roofs and structures designed to be used by nesting birds and insects.

2. Non carbon neutral business travel should be limited and conducted in as carbon neutral manner as reasonable. 

3. Direct consumption: Food packaging, office supplies, and marketing materials must be sustainable to the extent possible. We will prefer non-packaged food and food in re-usable packaging to packaged food and biodegradable food packaging to non-biodegradable. Sustainability must be prioritized when choosing office supplies and marketing materials.

Core Value 3: Family
------------------------

Our workers must be able to spend time with their family if they wish. This also applies to "de-facto" family members, such as non-married long term partners and their children.

1. Displacement: We should avoid separating families by encouraging workers to relocate without their family. If relocation is necessary we should make sure we take into account the costs of family relocation and re-emberse those costs to the extent reasonable.

2. Sickness: Workers should be able to take unpaid time off to spend time with sick family members without repercussions to their careers.

3. Children: Unless the law provides better, workers with long term contracts should receive 6 months paid leave to use during the first two years of each of their children's lives. Workers with long term contracts may take unpaid leave for up to 3 years during the first 7 years of their children's lives without loosing their positions.

Core Value 4: Don't stifle innovation
--------------------------------------------

While most software Gradesta will produce is Free Open Source Software, there is nothing in our codex against producing proprietary software and/or patenting inventions. However, one of our core values is to never use patents to stifle innovation. We will always be willing to license our patents individually, and for a reasonable price, even to direct competitors.

Core Value 5: That's not all
---------------------------------

This document only includes values that are likely to differ from those of other businesses. Other values such as legality, safe workplaces, preventing harassment ect. also apply.
