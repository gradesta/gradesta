The Active Maitainer's License (AML-GR)
---------------------------------------------

This license was created with the hope of allowing for a new way of collaborating on software, that can be financed in ways not possible using traditional FLOSS licenses. It allows for copying, modifying, and distributing the work and derivative works, but it only permits use for those who are active maintaners or license that right from an active maintainer.

The goal of the license is to allow for open collaborative development without vendor lockin and guaranteeing access to software. I want to break free of current SAAS open core/open library business models and dual licensing. SAAS open core/open lib models are not very open, and dual licensing is not good for collaboration due to the asymetric retionship between outside contributors and the "main" contributor who demands the right to dual license. Dual licensing is incapable of providing funding for multiple parties without "dual licensing" collectives (which are also a great idea but haven't taken off yet unfortunately).

**Goal:**
 1. Prevent vendor lockin
 2. Guarantee access to the software
 3. Allow multiple comercial entities to collaborate on the development of the software
 4. Allow developers to earn money by selling the software
