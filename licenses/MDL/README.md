MDL - Multideveloper License
-----------------------------------

**Section §0 - Preamble**

It is common for companies providing commercial support for an open source project to ask contributors to sign a CLA in order to allow for easy relicensing and the sale of commercial licenses. CLAs tend to take rights away from contributors and give those rights to the host company. The MDL is intended to provide the same benefits of a CLA, but to not tie the power to a specific legal entity and to give power over licensing decisions and revenue share back to the contributors.

**Section §1 - Definitions**:

a) **COLABORATIVE WORK**: A work or body of works wich has been composed over a period of time by one or more contributors.

b) **CONTRIBUTION**: A change to a COLABORATIVE WORK made by a contributor.

c) **DOCUMENTED TIME INVESTMENT VOTE (DTIV)**: Each DTIV is one person hour invested in the creation of a CONTRIBUTION. For DTIVs to be valid they must be documented and published online by way of an audiovisual screencast and show the creation of the contribution. The contribution must be novel and related to the COLABORATIVE WORK. The author of a DTIV has one vote per DTIV recorded. DTIVs are non-transferable, they belong to the author of the CONTRIBUTION and no one else.

d) **JOINTLY OWNED WORK**: A COLABORATIVE WORK, an archive of all CONTRIBUTIONs along with attributions to the contributors as well as all DTIVs associated with the creation of those CONTRIBUTIONs.

e) **FORK***: A pair of JOINTLY OWNED WORKS for which at least %60 of the DTIVs are identical.

f) **LICENSOR**: A legal entity which has been nominated by at least %60 of the DTIVs associated with a JOINTLY OWNED WORK.

**Section §5 - DTIVs**

b) The screencasts must be published using a widely readable file format.
c) The screencasts must be released under the Creative Commons Attribution No derivatives license (though they may be licensed in other ways as well)
d) Owners of DTIVs may sell their nominations or otherwise profit from the nomination of a LICENSOR.

**Section §6 - Combining works**

a) Two FORKs of the same work may be combined and be treated as one JOINTLY OWNED WORK. Voting rights of the DTIVs are equal.
b) Two distinct works under this license may be combined. Works are considered distinct if they share less than %60 of their DTIVs. When two distinct works are combined, usage and performance rights to each work must be licensed separately unless LICENSORs for each work agree otherwise.

**Section §7 - Updating this license**

a) Anyone may publicly propose a change to this license
b) If that change is publicly nominated by %80 of the DTIVs, the license will be updated
