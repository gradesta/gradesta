Code of Conduct
===================

This code of conduct is derived from and very similar to the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/) and we believe in spirit essentially identical.

The Gradesta Open Source community hopes to be made up of members from around the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our community hopes to experience great successes and continued growth. When you're working with members of the community, this Code of Conduct will help steer your interactions and keep the Gradesta Open Source community a positive, successful, and growing community.

Our Community
----------------

We hope that members of the Gradesta Open Source community will be _welcoming_, _considerate_, and _respectful_. Behaviours that reinforce these values contribute to a positive environment, and include:

 - Being open. Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether it's on proposals, patches, problems, or otherwise.
 - Focusing on what is best for the community. We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them.
 - Acknowledging time and effort. We're respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate the Gradesta Open Source community. We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often times the labor was completed simply for the good of the community.
 - Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences. We're receptive to constructive comments and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts.
 - Showing empathy towards other community members. We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.
 - Being considerate. Members of the community are considerate of their peers -- other Gradesta users.
 - Being respectful. We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts.
 - Gracefully accepting constructive criticism. When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
 - Using welcoming and inclusive language. We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.

Our Standards
----------------

The Gradesta Open Source community is dedicated to providing a positive experience as many people as possible, regardless of:
 - _Biology_: including age, genetics (race, sex), sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, health(including body size and mental health)
 - _Origin_: ethnicity, nationality, socio-economic status
 - And to the extent that they are not in conflict with the above: Identity and belief including religion or lack their of, political views, and gender identity.

Inappropriate Behavior
---------------------------

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

 - Harassment of any participants in any form

 - Creating additional online accounts in order to harass another person or circumvent a ban
 - Irrelevant sexual language and imagery in online communities or in any conference venue, including talks 
 - Insults, put downs, or jokes that are based upon stereotypes, that are exclusionary, or that hold others up for ridicule
 - Excessive swearing
 - Unwelcome sexual attention or advances: TODO make this more clear which advances are welcome and which are unwelcome for those who have trouble figuring that out on their own.
 - Unwelcome physical contact, including simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like "hug" or "backrub") without consent or after a request to stop
 - Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
 - Sustained disruption of online community discussions, in-person presentations, or other in-person events
 - Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
 - Other conduct that is inappropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds

Community members asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Weapons Policy
-----------------

No weapons are allowed at Gradesta events. Weapons include but are not limited to explosives (including fireworks), guns, and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon.

Consequences
--------------

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, Gradesta staff (TODO: we're too small to do the right thing here) may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community and community events with no refund of event tickets. The full list of consequences for inappropriate behavior is TODO TODO.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for everyone.
