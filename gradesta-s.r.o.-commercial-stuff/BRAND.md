Gradesta Brand identity
-----------------------

We build software that is **Cozy**, **Safe**, and **Consistant**.

Users should not feel scared that they will break something, or hurt someone, or lose money unexpectedly. They shouldn't have to wory about whether the software is manipulating them to buy a product, our software should be **trustworthy**.

We are not slumlords looking to get users hooked on a digital "social drug". We want **healthy**, **productive**, and **prosperous** users. We believe these users can **pay more than adicts**. 

What our software is not:
--------------------------

Our software does not try to be **familiar**. We aren't afraid to teach users something new.
